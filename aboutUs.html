    <h3>Our Vission</h3>
    <p>
      We see a future where picking up or dropping off anything — from a package
      to a meal — is as simple as scanning a code. SmartBox aims to be part of
      everyday life, helping communities and businesses save time, stay
      connected, and enjoy greater peace of mind.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      At SmartBox, our mission is simple: to make life easier. We provide
      secure, smart lockers that let people collect parcels, food, or personal
      items whenever it suits them. No queues, no waiting — just safe,
      convenient access, 24/7. We’re here to take the stress out of storage and
      delivery so people and businesses can focus on what really matters.
