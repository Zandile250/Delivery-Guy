Here's how the site looks on different devices:

**Tablet (768px)**
<img src="screenshots/Tablet.PNG" width="500">

**Desktop (1440px)**
<img src="screenshots/Desktop.PNG" width="700">

Responsive Design
Made the website work on different screen sizes using media queries:

- **Mobile (phones)**: Everything stacks vertically, buttons are full width
- **Tablet**: Two-column layout, medium-sized text
- **Desktop**: Full three-column gallery, bigger text, more spacing

-What I Tested
Checked the website on Chrome DevTools at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1440px (desktop).

Responsive Design
The website layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. This was achieved using Bootstrap 5, which provides flexible grid systems and responsive components.

Interactive FAQ (Accordion)
On the service.html page, I added an accordion component using Vanilla JavaScript. This allows users to click on a question and reveal the answer, improving the overall user experience and keeping the page clean and easy to navigate.

Form Validation & AJAX
On the contactUs.html page, I implemented client-side form validation to ensure users fill in all required fields correctly. The form also uses AJAX submission, which sends the data without reloading the page and displays a success message after submission. This makes the inquiry process smoother and more user-friendly.

- Updated index.html to include a consistent header navigation bar, ensuring users can easily access all pages from any part of the site. I also fixed layout issues and improved accessibility by adjusting color contrast and button spacing.
- Expanded aboutUs.html with detailed sections on company history, awards, customer reviews, services, and target users. This helps communicate SmartBox’s mission and impact more clearly to visitors.
- Styled headings using Bootstrap’s success color to visually highlight key sections like “Benefits” and “Our Journey.”
- Improved video background visibility by removing conflicting background colors and ensuring overlay transparency.
- Added README.md to document the project’s purpose, features, technologies used, and recent changes.

- Embedded a responsive Google Map showing SmartBox HQ in Bryanston, Sandton
- Added company address, contact number, and operating hours for clarity and professionalism
- Styled headings and borders using SmartBox brand color #efd364 for visual consistency
- Improved layout responsiveness across devices and ensured accessibility for all users
