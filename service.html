      access. Whether it’s picking up an online order, collecting a package, or
      storing personal items for a short time, SmartBox makes the process simple
      and contactless. Customers receive a unique QR code, scan it at the box,
      and instantly access their items — no queues, no staff needed, and
      available 24/7.
